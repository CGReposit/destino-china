The opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics, held on 8 August 2008 at the Beijing National Stadium is (in my opinion) the most ambitious, meticulously choreographed, and symbolically dense ceremonies in Olympic history. 

Directed by an acclaimed Chinese filmmaker (Zhang Yimou), the event functioned not only as a celebration of sport, but as a grand presentation to the world of Chinese civilization, identity, and modern aspirations.

The Chinese had wanted to host the Olympic games for quite some time. They came frustratingly close to achieving it in 2000, where Beijing led every round of voting but lost in the final round to Sydney by two votes. 

China’s desire to host the 2008 Summer Olympics was driven by a combination of political and symbolic objectives. Hosting the Olympics is one of the most visible ways a country can assert global status - or at least that is the perception the IOC wants to give. The core idea was for China to present itself as a modern, confident, and influential global power. Every facet of the Olympic bid and indeed, the Opening Ceremony was intended to showcase the country for it had been, as well as what it would evidently be in the near future. 

I think few could have anticipated in 2008 the civilzational presentation that would follow or its scale.
