The opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics, held on 8 August 2008 at the Beijing National Stadium is (in my opinion) the most ambitious, meticulously choreographed, and symbolically dense ceremonies in Olympic history. 

Directed by an acclaimed Chinese filmmaker (Zhang Yimou), the event functioned not only as a celebration of sport, but as a grand presentation to the world of Chinese civilization, identity, and modern aspirations.

The Chinese had wanted to host the Olympic games for quite some time. They came frustratingly close to achieving it in 2000, where Beijing led every round of voting but lost in the final round to Sydney by two votes. 

China’s desire to host the 2008 Summer Olympics was driven by a combination of political and symbolic objectives. Hosting the Olympics is one of the most visible ways a country can assert global status - or at least that is the perception the IOC wants to give. The core idea was for China to present itself as a modern, confident, and influential global power. Every facet of the Olympic bid and indeed, the Opening Ceremony was intended to showcase the country for everything it had been, as well as what it would be in the near future. 

I think few in 2008 could have anticipated the civilzational presentation that would follow or its enormous scale. The 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony featured roughly 15,000 performers in the "Bird's Nest" stadium. The ceremony was attended by over 91,000 spectators, including over 100 international leaders. It is claimed that an estimated 2 billion people worldwide, making it one of the most-watched events in history. 

For my part, I remember quite clearly watching the entire of the ceremony from my living room in Gandía, España. 

The unsurpassed night of glory is still a fond memory for Olympic enthusiasts and Chinese citizens The four-hour extravaganza, depicted an immensely proud nation that has made monumental contributions to humanity and seeks unity and harmony with nature and other nations as it continues its rise on the world stage. Indeed, it was a perfect presentation of the image China seeks to promote in international affairs

The ceremony focused heavily on the glories of China's ancient past - and had largely omitted the more recent aspects of its past.
